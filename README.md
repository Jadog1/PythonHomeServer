Scripts ran daily from my home server to extract data

This works in accordance with my webpage, in which my wife and I use to act as our app. I have a local database instance running which we store long-term data.

These scripts help us store data for finances (Moreso for budget planning) and to send out reminders to ourselves. It is our goal in the near future to include more things, and IoT devices.
